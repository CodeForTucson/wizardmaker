<h1>Help for the Picture or Video Element Page</h1>
<h3>You have make a choice right away</h3>  
<p>
Decide if you want to set a Placeholder or Upload an Image.

<p>  
You may be creating the wizard as you perform the task but are not ready to upload images and video immediately. 
So instead, add a placeholder, a note, to upload one later. You may want to do this for several reasons.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You are roughing out your wizard on a mobile device and want to check out the images on a larger screen before selecting.</li>
	<li>You already have some images on your computer you may want to use.</li>
	<li>You want to crop the images and reduce their resolution before uploading them to save on storage and to speed load time of your wizard.  
	Images of about 800 pixels in the shortest dimension are fine.</li>
	<li>You want to highlight parts of the image or annotate them to point out specific parts of the image.</li>
	<li>You have a movie but you want to shorten it and reduce the image quality to save on storage and improve upload time.</li>
	<li>You need to convert the movie to mp4 format.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We recommend that movies be as short as possible. Just show something, in a few seconds, that cannot be easily explained 
with words and pictures.  For example, You can show how chefs professionally dice an onion in under 10 seconds of 
video but it would take a lot of words and pictures to explain it.
You may also need to convert your movie to mp4 format.  That is the only format that WizardMaker will show. 
</p>
<h3>Adding a Placeholder</h3>
<p>
To add a placeholder just select the Set a Placeholder button.  The two buttons will be replace with an input 
field and a Save button.  Just type your note such as “Put nice shot of garden here” and select Save.
</p>

<p>
Later you can return to this screen and select Upload a Picture or Video to replace the placeholder with a picture or video.
</p>

<h3>Uploading Pictures and Video</h3>
<p>
If you have pictures and video ready to upload
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select Choose File</li>
	<li>Select the file you want from your computer. Make sure the file name is right and video is mp4 (see below)</li>
	<li>Select Upload Image</li>
	<li>Check progress at the bottom of your browser</li>
</ol>

<h3>Converting video</h3>
<p>
If you shoot your video with an iPhone and own a Mac.  Download it to the Mac, change the file name extension from .m4v 
to .mp4 and upload it using the method discussed above.
If you have an MOV file, open iMove and import it as media.  Then share it as a file.  
Pick a low resolution and medium quality to keep the file size down.
For other formats you can find free converters in the App Store for Mac.
